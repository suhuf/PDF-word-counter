**Completions**

Iterates through directories ✅

Parses PDF files ✅

Standardized output text that is easy to interact with ✅

**Current road map:**



  Add index/dictionary at end to show word occurence based on every document or something similar

  Ensure the word matching funtionality will ignore case but will still capitalize when added to respective dictionary

  Add in modular functionality for anyones folders/directories once baseline is complete.


  Possibly add a GUI via tkinter instead of using command line.
